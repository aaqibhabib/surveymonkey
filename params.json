I don't do much styling,\r\ninput validation, error checking, or unit testing. The app structure is important.\r\nsrc/app/home has the app. If the app were larger, I would build pages out like src/app/about.\r\nI made sure to group related file together such as home and home/modal.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
